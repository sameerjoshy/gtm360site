    <div class="space-y-4">
      Challenge:<br><br>AWS was expanding rapidly into Korea, ASEAN, and ANZ markets — but lacked localized GTM playbooks and partner strategies.<br><br>Approach:<br><br>Defined region-specific GTM models with geo headcount planning, partner capability mapping, and pipeline coverage ratios. Delivered these through a regional RevOps overlay.<br><br>Outcome:<br><br>Established scalable GTM motions in 3 markets. Partner-sourced revenue grew 3x. Region transitioned from reactive to proactive pipeline planning.<br><br>Quote:<br><br>“Helped us localize and lead. Their RevOps and partner strategy let us play offense in every market.”
