    <div class="space-y-4">
      Challenge:<br><br>Innovapptive had strong enterprise traction but lacked the RevOps infrastructure to scale into mid-market and global territories.<br><br>Approach:<br><br>Established a Revenue Ops center of excellence in India. Rebuilt the full commercial engine (lead gen to CS) and implemented Salesforce, Outreach, Gainsight, and dashboards.<br><br>Outcome:<br><br>90% YoY growth. Entered EU/APAC with a lite product. Hired a global partner manager and expanded via channel.<br><br>Quote:<br><br>“RevOps wasn’t a function — it became a growth engine. We were flying blind before.”
