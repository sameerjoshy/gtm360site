    <div class="space-y-4">
      Challenge:<br><br>Company was entering cost-sensitive markets but had a direct-sales-heavy motion that lacked reach and efficiency.<br><br>Approach:<br><br>Designed a full channel strategy — from partner profiling to onboarding to incentives. Identified, recruited, and enabled 12+ key partners.<br><br>Outcome:<br><br>40% of revenue in those markets now comes via partners. CAC dropped. Partner managers run a quarterly review system.<br><br>Quote:<br><br>“They didn’t just find partners — they built a program. We now have a real partner-led motion.”
