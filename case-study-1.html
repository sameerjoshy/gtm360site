    <div class="space-y-4">
      Challenge:<br><br>When the AWS business unit was still early stage (~$50M revenue), it lacked structure in its GTM segmentation, tooling, and regional execution planning.<br><br>Approach:<br><br>We built a multi-segment GTM strategy tailored for Startups, SMBs, and Enterprise accounts. Created vertical-specific motions, mapped account plans by region, and implemented scalable RevOps systems.<br><br>Outcome:<br><br>Revenue scaled from $50M to $1B+ in 5 years. Org grew from 35 to 400+ people. RevOps became a global center of excellence.<br><br>Quote:<br><br>“They turned chaos into cadence. From market segmentation to hiring strategy — this team helped us scale fast without breaking.”
